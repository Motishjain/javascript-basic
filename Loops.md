# Loops

## Overview

In programming, whenever we like to re-run the same code multiple times, 'Loops' are used.

## Learning Outcome

- What is a loop?
- How to write a loop?
- Different types of loops?

## Introduction

As the name suggests, the statements written inside a loop are set to run repeatedly. 
The most important thing to understand in a for loop is the condition statement. This defines the criteria for the loop to run and once the condition fails, the looping stops.


## What must you do?
- Start with understanding the [basics of loops](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loops-in-javascript/).
- Next step is to learn how to write [different types of loops](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_for.asp) starting with the most commonly used loop i.e. the for-loop. This page has links to the other loops like for-in/for-of, etc.

# Variables & Loops

## Overview

In this topic, we will understand 'variables' which are the basic building blocks of any program, what data they can hold 
and how we can convert data from one type to another using type conversions.

## Learning Outcome

- What is a variable?
- Different types of data which can be assigned to a variable?
- How to convert data from one format to another?

## Introduction

*Variable*

As the name suggests, a variable is anything that can vary. It can hold data in different formats (which will be covered below) and it can be changed anytime. A variable can hold different types of data like numbers(5,6,7), strings("Hello World"), boolean(true/false), etc.

In JavaScript, you can assign new data of a different type to the same variable. A variable holding a particular type of data can be converted to another type by type casting. 


## What must you do?
- Go through the [basics of JavaScript variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)
-	Familiarize yourself with [different data types in JavaScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variables-datatypes-javascript/).
-	Next step is to understand [how data is converted from one type to another](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_type_conversion.asp)

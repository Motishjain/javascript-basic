# Variables & Loops

## Overview

In this topic, we will understand 'variables' which are the basic building blocks of any program, what data they can hold 
and how we can convert data from one type to another using type conversions.

We would also cover an interesting control flow in programming called 'Loops'. In simple terms - Eat. Sleep. Rave. Repeat is one kind of a loop :)
 Running the same set of instructions repeatedly is called a Loop in programming.

## Learning Outcome

- What is a variable?
- Different types of data which can be assigned to a variable?
- How to convert data from one format to another?
- How to write loops?
